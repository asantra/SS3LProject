lsetup git

git clone https://oducu@gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-phys-susy-wg/Common/SS3Lep.git



#### Assume you are in the project folder (SS3LAnalysis)

cd ..
mkdir build
cd build/
setupATLAS
asetup 21.2,AnalysisBase,r06
cmake ../SS3LAnalysis
cmake --build .



#### Or you just 

cd SS3LAnalysis
source initialize.sh 


### when i want to compile
in build directory:
cmake --build .



#### This is also nececary everytime you changed something and want to compile it!
#### If you just want to run the code and have nothing to compile, you could also do

source setupframework.sh



#### Each time you log in:

setupATLAS
cd ../build
asetup --restore
source */setup.sh

#### The script will automatically setup the same release as you previously defined in that directory. The --restore option restores the previous setup
