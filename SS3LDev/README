git clone https://oducu@gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-phys-susy-wg/Common/SS3Lep.git
cd SS3LEP
git tag -l
git checkout tags/<tag_name>


modify SS3Lep/SS3LAnalysis/SS3LAnalysis/scripts/Run.py file to point to your workdir & files
(search for "oducu" to see the lines you should change)


############### if you want to make changes in the framework:

git add *
git status
git commit
git push -u origin master


############### if you want to create a tag:

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging
git tag 1.0.0 6831ed70
git tag
git push origin 1.0.0





#### Assume you are in the project folder (SS3LAnalysis)

cd ..
mkdir build
cd build/
setupATLAS
asetup 21.2,AnalysisBase,r06
cmake ../SS3LAnalysis
cmake --build .



#### Or you just 

cd SS3LAnalysis
source initialize.sh 


### when you want to compile
in build directory:
cmake --build .



#### This is also nececary everytime you changed something and want to compile it!
#### If you just want to run the code and have nothing to compile, you could also do

source setupframework.sh



#### Each time you log in:

setupATLAS
cd ../build
asetup --restore
source */setup.sh

#### The script will automatically setup the same release as you previously defined in that directory. The --restore option restores the previous setup

#### Input datasets must be in the same format folder as they were downloaded and the run.py script should point to it, i.e.
mc16_13TeV.410080.MadGraphPythia8EvtGen_A14NNPDF23_4topSM.deriv.DAOD_SUSY2.e4111_s3126_r9364_r9315_p3387/
